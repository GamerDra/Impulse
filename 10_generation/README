# Task 10: Generation

To generate fake samples, we used GAN. A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** consists of two neural networks, a Generator and a Discriminator, trained simultaneously. The Generator creates fake data to mimic real data, while the Discriminator differentiates between real and fake data. The goal is to improve both until the Generator produces highly realistic data.

We trained the Generator and Discriminator for 200 epochs, and we got a average loss function of D_loss = 1.1007 and G_loss: 1.4758.

However, when we ran the same model with LSGAN, we reached an average loss function of  D_loss = 0.2467 and G_loss: 0.1282.

Here is an example plot of one of the generated samples (Normal_data):

We can use FID to check the similarity of the generated data with the original data.The Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) measures the similarity between real and generated data distributions. It computes the difference between their feature means and covariances, extracted using a pretrained model. A lower FID indicates higher similarity, meaning the generated data closely resembles the real data in quality and diversity.
